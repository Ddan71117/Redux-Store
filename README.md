Once that step is done, then clicking the desired button to either add or remove item from their cart becomes functional. Their are filter buttons at the top that users can click to filter desired products. Click on the shopping cart in the top right corner to view products in the cart. Once satisfied, click checkout to be redirected to the Stripe purchasing process.
